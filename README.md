# JetsProject

## Description
In this project we had a number of things we needed to utilize. We needed the user to be able to list out jets which have been read from a text file,
Fly all the jets in reserve. I used cargo and fighter jets as my different categories. We also needed to be able to allow user and add and remove jets from the fleet. As well as allow the user to quit once they done with the application.

## Tech used
I used Eclipse, github, and the terminal to complete this project. Some new techniques included: try/catch, array lists, extends, implements, abstract classes.

## Lessons learned
This project used a lot of inheridence and polymorphism in how the different classes relay information to each other. Throughout this project I learned a lot about how to successfully have multiple classes use and take information to one another and pass it through their related classes. The biggest challenge for me came early on in getting the fleet to read the jets and have the jets go to the correct type of plane it is. I feel aa lot more confident in getting classes to work together now.
